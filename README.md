# üå± FSMS - Sustainable Food Supply Chain

**FSMS (Food Supply Management System)** is a smart and sustainable food supply chain management system designed to optimize resources, reduce food waste, and enhance transparency throughout the supply chain ‚Äî from farm to fork. This project leverages data analytics, machine learning, and automation to create a greener, safer, and more efficient food ecosystem.

## üöÄ Project Goals

The aim of FSMS is to:
- Promote **sustainable agriculture and logistics**
- Reduce **waste and carbon emissions**
- Enable **real-time tracking** of resources (water, energy, transport)
- Predict **demand trends** using historical data
- Increase **transparency and traceability** across the food chain

## üîë Key Features

1. **Resource-Based Monitoring**  
   FSMS monitors water, energy, and transport emissions during farming and logistics to identify and reduce excess usage.

2. **Sustainability Standards Compliance**  
   Supports alignment with **UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)** and **ESG** criteria to ensure ethical and environmentally responsible practices.

3. **AI-Powered Demand Prediction**  
   Machine Learning models forecast future demand based on historical user data, helping producers align output with consumption patterns.

4. **Product Traceability**  
   Every product batch is traceable from origin to consumer, enabling quick recalls and fostering trust.

5. **Data Logging & Visual Analytics**  
   A powerful dashboard displays key metrics like carbon emissions, wastage rate, and utility consumption for informed decision-making.

6. **Real-Time Alerts**  
   IoT sensors or manual input notify stakeholders of threshold breaches in temperature, humidity, or emissions.

7. **Training & Guidelines**  
   Educational modules are available for farmers and logistics managers to implement sustainable practices.

8. **Continuous Improvement & Feedback**  
   Automatically suggests corrective measures and reports inefficiencies for ongoing optimization.
