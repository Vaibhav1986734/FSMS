# FSMS
**A Food Safety Management System (FSMS)** is a structured approach to managing food safety throughout the entire food supply chain, from farm to fork. The goal is to ensure that food is safe for consumption and that risks related to foodborne hazards are minimized. An FSMS integrates policies, procedures, and practices to ensure that food safety standards are met at all stages of food production, processing, handling, and distribution.
# The key features of a **Food Safety Management System (FSMS)** :

1. **Risk-Based Approach**: A restaurant identifies high-risk areas (e.g., raw meat handling) and implements specific controls, such as separate cutting boards for meats and vegetables.

2. **Compliance with Standards**: A food manufacturer follows **ISO 22000** or **HACCP** guidelines to monitor critical processes like cooking and cooling temperatures to prevent foodborne illnesses.

3. **Preventive Controls**: A bakery ensures that employees wash hands regularly, sanitize surfaces, and check expiration dates on ingredients to prevent contamination during food preparation.

4. **Traceability and Recall**: A supermarket tracks batch numbers of canned goods and can quickly pull a specific batch off the shelves if a recall is issued due to contamination.

5. **Documentation and Record-Keeping**: A juice processing plant keeps daily logs of cleaning schedules, ingredient quality checks, and temperature monitoring to demonstrate compliance with food safety standards.

6. **Continuous Monitoring**: A dairy farm uses automated sensors to monitor milk temperature and storage conditions, ensuring products remain within safe ranges until delivery.

7. **Training and Awareness**: A foodservice chain provides regular training to staff on personal hygiene, proper food storage, and handling practices to reduce food safety risks.

8. **Corrective Actions and Improvements**: A seafood distributor, after a product failure, revises its handling and storage procedures to prevent future issues, demonstrating continuous improvement in its FSMS.
